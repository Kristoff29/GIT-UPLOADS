From the tea ceremonies to the traditional arts of calligraphy and flower arrangement, Japanese culture is known for its attention to detail and appreciation for beauty. The country also has a long history of martial arts, including karate, judo, and kendo, which are still practiced today.

One of the most iconic aspects of Japanese culture is the cherry blossom, or sakura. In the spring, people flock to parks and gardens to admire the pink and white blooms and enjoy hanami, or cherry blossom viewing parties.

In addition to its cultural traditions, Japan is also known for its innovative spirit.</p>
